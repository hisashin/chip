# Summary

This project aims to make DNA test easy. As easy as pregnancy test with cheap disposable kits at room temperature.
No fridge, pipette, centrifuge, electrophoresis nor UV illuminator. DNA extractor([ex1](https://www.kaneka-labtest.com/en/pre/dna_version2.html), [ex2](https://www.funakoshi.co.jp/contents/64147)) and DNA chromatography chip([ex1](https://www.kaneka-labtest.com/en/chromato/index.html), [ex2](https://www.kurabo.co.jp/bio/English/product/products.php?M=D&PID=99), [ex3](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/06/zika-test/)) should be used instead. Thermal cycler is needed at first but we have [NinjaPCR](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaPCR) and might be removed in future with [such tech](https://www.twistdx.co.uk/en/products/product/twistamp-basic).

Use case examples :
- Food allergy patients (even kids) can test their food by themselves.
- In pandemic, people can pick a blood from finger and test infectious diseases like Zika, by themselves.
- Halal test
