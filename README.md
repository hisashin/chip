# Summary

This project aims to make DNA test easy. As easy as pregnancy test with cheap disposable kits at room temperature.
No fridge, pipette, centrifuge, electrophoresis nor UV illuminator. Use [DNA extractor](https://www.kaneka-labtest.com/en/pre/dna_version2.html) and [DNA chromatography chip](https://www.kaneka-labtest.com/en/chromato/index.html). PCR might be needed at first but we have [NinjaPCR](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaPCR) and will be removed in future with [such techs].

Use case examples :
- Food allergy patients (even) test their own food by themselves.
- In zika pandemic, people can pick a blood from finger and test it by themselves.
- Halal test
- (You can add here if come up)
